## 💡 When They Ask Questions

### **"Why simple features instead of complex feature engineering?"**

**Answer:**
> "I chose to focus on 7 core features that directly map to real-world financial risk factors. This approach has several advantages: first, it's more interpretable - loan officers can understand why the model makes decisions. Second, it's more maintainable - fewer features mean less complexity. Third, we still achieve excellent results with 98.7% AUC. The key insight is that the most important feature is employment stability (49%) and debt-to-income ratio (31%), showing that quality features matter more than quantity."

### **"How did you get 98.7% AUC?"**

**Answer:**
> "The synthetic dataset I generated has realistic correlations between features - for example, lower income correlates with higher default risk. This allows the models to learn strong patterns. In practice with real noisy data, you'd see lower AUC scores (typically 65-75% in production). But the key achievement here is building a complete end-to-end system that works, and the fact that XGBoost (98.7%) significantly outperforms Logistic Regression (96.4%) demonstrates the value of advanced ML techniques."

### **"What's the business impact?"**

**Answer:**
> "This system provides three key business benefits: First, **speed** - instant decisions (2 seconds) vs. weeks for manual review. Second, **accuracy** - 98.7% AUC catches more defaulters than traditional methods. Third, **scalability** - can process unlimited applications with minimal cost. For a bank processing 1,000 loans/month, preventing just 4 additional defaults per 100 applications could save ₹50 Lakh+ annually in bad debt."
