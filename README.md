## 📊 Dataset

**Simple, clean dataset with 7 essential features:**

| Feature | Description | Calculation |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `AGE` | Borrower age in years | Direct input from application |
| `ANNUAL_INCOME` | Yearly income (₹) | Total gross income before taxes |
| `CREDIT_SCORE` | CIBIL score (300-900) | Calculated by credit bureau based on payment history, amounts owed, credit length, etc. |
| `LOAN_AMOUNT` | Requested loan amount (₹) | Amount borrower wants to borrow |
| `YEARS_AT_JOB` | Employment stability | Years employed at current job |
| `EXISTING_LOANS` | Current loan count | Number of active loans (mortgage, car, personal, etc.) |
| `DEBT_TO_INCOME_RATIO` | Financial burden | (Total Monthly Debt / Monthly Income) × 100 |

### 📈 Key Calculated Features

#### **1. Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**
**Formula:** `(Total Monthly Debt Payments / Gross Monthly Income) × 100%`

**Example:**
- Monthly debt: ₹15,000 (EMI + credit cards + other loans)
- Monthly income: ₹50,000
- DTI = (15,000 / 50,000) × 100 = **30%**

**Risk Interpretation:**
- DTI < 30%: Low risk ✅
- DTI 30-50%: Moderate risk ⚠️
- DTI > 50%: High risk ❌

#### **2. Probability of Default (PD)**
**What it is:** Likelihood (0-1 or 0-100%) that borrower will default on loan

**How it's calculated:** Using Machine Learning models

**Process:**
1. Train models on historical data (features → actual outcomes)
2. Models learn patterns (e.g., low income + high DTI = more defaults)
3. Apply to new applicants to predict PD score

**Example Predictions:**
```
Applicant A: PD = 0.15 (15%) → Low Risk → APPROVE
Applicant B: PD = 0.65 (65%) → High Risk → REJECT
```

**Stats:**
- Training samples: 5,000
- Test samples: 1,000
- Default rate: 9%

   - Shows financial burden level
3. **Annual income** - 7%
   - Higher income = lower default risk
   - Shows repayment capacity
4. **Credit score** - 6%
   - Past payment behavior indicator
   - Higher score = better history
5. **Loan amount** - 2%
   - Larger loans = higher risk
   - Repayment burden consideration
6. **Age** - 2%
   - Age affects risk profile
